While Ukrainian port calls fell, they increased in Romania and Bulgaria as Ukrainian traders were seeking alternative viable routes. In addition, the halt of operations at Black Sea ports resulted in an important shift: rivers became the main artery of Ukrainian trade. Before the war, more than 90 per cent of ships departed from seaports. Following the invasion, this share dropped to 20 per cent. However, this increased reliance on river ports came with constraints as it could not handle large ships.  ',

Russia and Ukraine are major global suppliers of grains and edible oils.The prospect of the Black Sea Grain Initiative and the reopening of the Black Sea ports helped to push down historically high market prices. However, prices have begun to rise again amid mounting concerns about whether the BSGI will be renewed, and the threat of further disruptions to trade in the Black Sea and the closure of grain corridors. Without The Initiative, there is little hope for providing food security, especially for developing and least developed countries.',
